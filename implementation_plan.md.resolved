# Fix Sandbox Component Resolution Errors

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This change introduces a "soft failure" mode for missing components. Instead of crashing the entire preview with "Element type is invalid", missing components will render as `null` (invisible) or a fallback UI, allowing the rest of the preview to function. This is generally preferred for sandboxes but might hide some errors during development.

## Proposed Changes

### Sandbox
#### [MODIFY] [preview-runner.tsx](file:///n:/comps/sandbox/src/components/preview-runner.tsx)
- Wrap the return value of [customRequire](file:///n:/comps/sandbox/src/components/preview-runner.tsx#163-228) in a `Proxy`.
- The `Proxy` will trap [get](file:///n:/comps/sandbox/src/components/preview-runner.tsx#59-60) operations.
- If a property (export) exists, return it.
- If it does not exist, return a fallback Functional Component that logs a warning to the console and renders nothing (or a placeholder).
- Ensure the default export is also handled correctly.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Open the Preview**: Use the application to generate a component that uses a non-existent export (e.g., `import { NonExistent } from "lucide-react"`).
2.  **Check Console**: Verify that the browser console logs a warning about the missing component instead of throwing a React error.
3.  **Check UI**: Verify that the rest of the component renders correctly, even if the missing part is blank.
4.  **Confirm Fix**: The "Element type is invalid" error overlay should no longer appear for missing exports.
